# Grade-Prediction
A Fuzzy Logic-based Grade Prediction System that estimates a student's final grade based on attendance, marks, and assignments using Python and scikit-fuzzy

This project implements a **Fuzzy Logic-based Grade Prediction System** using **Python** and **scikit-fuzzy**.  
It estimates the **final grade** of a student based on:  
✔ **Attendance Percentage**  
✔ **Marks Percentage**  
✔ **Assignments Completion**  

## 🚀 Features  
- Uses **fuzzy logic** to predict student grades.  
- Implements **Triangular Membership Functions** for attendance, marks, assignments, and final grade.  
- Defines **15 fuzzy rules** to determine the final grade.  
- **Plots membership functions** for attendance, marks, assignments, and final grade.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **scikit-fuzzy (skfuzzy)**
